Question 1 : Using the RMS Titanic data, how accurate would a prediction be that none of the passengers survived?
	     Hint: Run the code cell below to see the accuracy of this prediction.


def accuracy_score(truth, pred):
    """ Returns accuracy score for input truth and predictions. """
    
    # Ensure that the number of predictions matches number of outcomes
    if len(truth) == len(pred): 
        
        # Calculate and return the accuracy as a percent
        return "Predictions have an accuracy of {:.2f}%.".format((truth == pred).mean()*100)
    
    else:
        return "Number of predictions does not match number of outcomes!"
    
# Test the 'accuracy_score' function
predictions = pd.Series(np.ones(5, dtype = int))
print(accuracy_score(outcomes[:5], predictions))
